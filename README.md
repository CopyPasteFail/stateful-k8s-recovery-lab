# stateful-k8s-recovery-lab

A production-oriented reference implementation for running a stateful application on Kubernetes with automated backup, point-in-time restore, and full observability.

The application is a Go API-only key-value service backed by LevelDB. Everything here—backup, restore, monitoring, alerting—is designed to be understandable, operable, and extensible rather than minimal or toy-grade.

---

## What this demonstrates

- Running a stateful workload as a Kubernetes `StatefulSet` with a persistent `PersistentVolumeClaim`
- Automated Restic backups to a local MinIO bucket on a 6-hour `CronJob` schedule
- Safe manual backup and restore with concurrency guards and rollback steps
- Full observability: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Alertmanager rules, and Loki log aggregation
- A Makefile-driven operator workflow with idempotent shell scripts backing every target

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 / WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04
- Docker Engine (not Docker Desktop)
- k3d, kubectl, Helm

Run `make check-prereqs` to verify your environment. Run `make install-prereqs` to install missing tools, or `make install-docker` for the Docker Engine setup step.

> **Bootstrap note:** `make install-prereqs` installs `make` itself. If `make` is not yet present, either install it first (`sudo apt-get install -y make`) or run the script directly: `bash scripts/install-prereqs.sh`.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CopyPasteFail/stateful-k8s-recovery-lab.git
cd stateful-k8s-recovery-lab

make demo       # app + MinIO + backup — the core workflow (~3-5 min)
make demo-full  # adds Prometheus, Grafana, Loki (~10-15 min first run)
```

Or run steps individually:

```bash
make check-prereqs        # verify environment
make bootstrap            # create k3d cluster and namespaces
make deploy-minio         # deploy MinIO into minio-system (local S3 backend)
make deploy               # deploy the app StatefulSet (no CRD dependency)
make deploy-observability # deploy Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager
MONITORING=1 make deploy  # re-deploy app with ServiceMonitor + PrometheusRule enabled
make seed-data            # write sample keys to verify the app works
make smoke-test           # run end-to-end sanity checks
```

> **Restore is not part of the demo.** Restore is a disruptive recovery operation — it scales the app to zero and overwrites PVC data. To validate it manually after the demo: `make restore`

### Local app development (no cluster required)

```bash
make test-app             # run Go unit tests
make run-app-local        # start the app on localhost:18081 (data in .local/leveldb)

# Example usage while running:
curl         http://localhost:18081/
curl -X PUT  http://localhost:18081/kv/greeting -d "hello"
curl         http://localhost:18081/kv/greeting
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:18081/kv/greeting
curl         http://localhost:18081/healthz
curl         http://localhost:18081/metrics
```

A CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs these same Go tests on every push and pull request, along with ShellCheck on all shell scripts and `helm lint` / `helm template` on the chart — no cluster required.

---

## Backup and restore workflow

```bash
make backup              # trigger a one-off Job from the backup CronJob spec
make backup-status       # show CronJob status and recent Job logs
make suspend-backups     # pause the CronJob (maintenance window)
make resume-backups      # re-enable the CronJob

make restore             # guided restore: scale down, restore snapshot, scale up
make restore-drill       # end-to-end drill: write keys, backup, corrupt, restore, verify
```

The backup CronJob runs every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`, `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`).
It mounts the app PVC read-only and runs Restic against the LevelDB data directory.
MinIO (in-cluster) is the Restic backend. Local demo credentials are in
`helm-values/minio.yaml` — replace with external secrets for production.

> **Local demo vs production:** The CronJob backs up the live-mounted data directory.
> This is acceptable for exercising the workflow. Production should back up from an
> LVM or CSI volume snapshot for crash-consistency.
> See [docs/backup-restore.md](docs/backup-restore.md) for details.

## Observability

```bash
make port-forward        # open Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager locally
make logs                # tail app and backup Job logs via Loki
make status              # summarize cluster, StatefulSet, PVC, and CronJob state
```

See [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md) for dashboard and alert details.

## Scope and limitations

- **Local POC** runs on k3d. It does not require production-scale data volumes—a few megabytes is sufficient to exercise the full workflow.
- **LevelDB is single-writer**. Horizontal scaling with multiple replicas sharing one dataset is not safe. See [docs/tradeoffs.md](docs/tradeoffs.md) for the rationale and recommended scaling models.
- **Production design** extends this foundation with LVM snapshots for backup consistency, external secret management, cloud object storage, and NetworkPolicies.
